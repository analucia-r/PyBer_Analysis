# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis
We has to create an exploratory analysis and visualizations using the rideshare data to perform the annalysis. The reason behind the analysis was to improve the accessability for rideshare services in differite types of areas in the city. The Datafram information provides three type of cities: rural, surburban and urban. The analysis was done during a five month period longing from January 2019 to May 2019. 
# Results 

This first pie chart shows the percentage of of total fares depending on the city type. It was caluclated by getting each percentage of the city types from the total percentage. It should that Urband and Suburban areas had a biggger total than rural areas. With this pie plot we notices how overall Urban city type uses ride shares more and is more profitiable in this type of city. This will give us a general idea for the rest of the analysis moving foward.

The second pie chart explains the total percentage rides by city type, like mentioned before this shows how in Urban cities ride shares are used more often. This can be proved by because it is known for urban cities to have more activities and places to visit compared to Rural or Surbaban areas. Therefore, urban cities having more opprtunity to do things means more likeness to get to one place or another using a ride share app if a personal vehicle is not aviaialble.

The last pie chart onces agains proves that ride sharing apps have more drivers in urban citites because of higher demand. With 80.9% it shows drivers are more active and have more work opprtunity in the urban cities compares to rural or surburban. In Rural areas which is usally characterized by the countryside and homes are so spread out there is also more use of personal vehicles and on our pie chart holding a palce at 2.6% it's total drivers working for ride share.

This data frame shows the Pyber summary of total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and per driver in each city type. It seems to be when there is a higher total rides by default means there is more drivers doing the work. Meaning more profit for the Pyber company but dividing the total fare by more drivers means the far that each driver is making is far less then working with a smallar population in rural or surbuban cities.

This final chart shows all city types have a higher increase in the mend of February and a drop right in the beggining of March. Overall in this time period that we analysized we can observe the Urban City type has the higest total of fares while rural areas had the least. It does also show that in the beggining of January and towards the end of April the fares for each type of city show a decline. 

# Summary 
- Urband cities have the most amount when it comes to ride count, drivers and rates which means being the most profitable for the company. Being the best performing there should be more investments in this city type to generate more revenue. 
- The least city type was Rural, but it has have the higest fair among the rest. If there are more riders there can be more job opportunity for the drivers and they can generate more income. The should be an incvestement down in marketing for this type of services in this area in particular. 
- Suburban areas are the middle result of the whole analysis. All the metrics calculated shows they were never over but usually under the median. At at steady pace there should be more focus on Rural and Suburban areas for growth within the company's goals.
